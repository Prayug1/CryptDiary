# CryptDiary 🔐

A secure, encrypted personal diary application with multi-user support and digital signatures.

## Features

- **Hybrid Encryption** – Diary entries are encrypted using AES-256 + RSA-2048
- **Digital Signatures** – Each entry is signed with RSA-PSS to ensure authenticity
- **X.509 Certificates** – Auto-generated self-signed certificates per user
- **Multi-User Support** – Separate keystores and diary storage per user
- **Certificate Revocation** – Global revocation list to invalidate compromised keys
- **Secure Entry Sharing** – Export/import entries with embedded certificate verification
